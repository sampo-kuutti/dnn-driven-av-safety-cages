# Safe deep neural network-driven autonomous vehicles using software safety cages

This is the repo for paper Safe deep neural network-driven autonomous vehicles using software safety cages. 
Train an imitation learning policy to control an autonomous agent for vehicle following. 
Additionally, safety cages can be used to ensure safety and provide additional training signal when the policy
makes a mistake.


## Installation
